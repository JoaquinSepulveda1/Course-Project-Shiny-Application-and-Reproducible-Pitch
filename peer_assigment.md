About the Course Project
========================================================

This is a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

Instructions:

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

2. Deploy the application on Rstudioâ€™s shiny server.

3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box.

4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github.


How to use the application
========================================================
- Using the data provided by Iris dataset, we separate the sample into different groups according to their characteristics by using the K-means algorithm

- The application is running on (https://joaquinsepulveda.shinyapps.io/peer/?_ga=2.28119996.1458695858.1624210026-1817511704.1624210026)

- ui.R, and Server.R Code in my github repository (https://github.com/JoaquinSepulveda1/Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch)

Iris dataset
========================================================

The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris.
